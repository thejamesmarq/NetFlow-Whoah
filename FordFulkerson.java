 *
 * An implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing maximum s-t
 * flows in a graph.  The algorithm, which dates back to 1956, is one of the
 * oldest and simplest max-flow algorithms.  The algorithm works by maintaining
 * a candidate max flow, constructing the residual graph for that max flow,
 * then searching for an augmenting s-t path in the graph.  If one is found,
 * then the maximum possible flow is pushed along that path and the process is
 * repeated.  Otherwise, because no augmenting paths exist, the flow must be
 * maximum and the algorithm reports this resulting flow.  Assuming that the
 * flow network has integral capacities, each time an augmenting path is found
 * the s-t flow increases by at least one, and so the algorithm is guaranteed
 * to terminate in after at most F searches, where F is the value of the max-
 * flow.
 *
 * Constructing and maintaining the residual graph ends up being reasonably
 * straightforward.  We can initially create the residual graph in O(m + n)
 * time by cloning the original graph and adding a reverse edge for each edge
 * in the graph.  Whenever we augment along some path of length k, we can
 * update the residual graph in O(k) time by simply adjusting the capacities
 * of the forward and reverse edges for each of the edges along the path.
 *
 * The only remaining task is finding some augmenting path from s to t.  This
 * can be done using a depth-first search in the graph, which takes O(m + n)
 * time.  As mentioned earlier, there can be at most F iterations of the
 * algorithm, and so the overall runtime for these phases is O((m + n)F).  The
 * net runtime of the algorithm is similarly O((m + n)F), since the search
 * time dominates the time required to construct the graph.  If we assume that
 * the graph is connected, m + n = O(m), and so the total runtime is O(mF).
 * This is not a polynomial-time algorithm, though, because the value of F can
 * be exponentially larger than the size of the input.  However, for graphs
 * where the flow can be easily bounded (for example, if all capacities are
 * zero or one), then the runtime of this algorithm is quite good.  In fact,
 * several polynomial-time max-flow algorithms, such as the scaling version of
 * this algorithm, use it as a subroutine.
