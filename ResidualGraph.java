 *
 * A class representing the residual graph of a flow network.  The residual
 * graph is the graph formed as follows:
 *
 * Given an input graph G = (V, E), the residual graph G' = (V', E') is the
 * graph where
 *
 *  * V' = V  (All the nodes from the original graph are present in the new
 *             graph)
 *  * For all (u, v) in E, there are two edges (u, v) and (v, u) in E' where
 *    the capacity of (u, v) is the capacity of (u, v) minus the flow across 
 *    (u, v), and the capacity of (v, u) is the flow across (u, v).
 *
 * The intution behind this graph is that the residual graph is a flow network
 * in which pushing a given unit of flow across an edge either corresponds to
 * pushing a unit of flow across an edge in the original graph OR retracting a
 * unit of flow across an edge in the original graph.  Rather than associating
 * with each edge a capacity and a flow, only a capacity is associated.  The
 * flow across an edge is represented implicitly by the amount of capacity
 * remaining on its residual edge.
