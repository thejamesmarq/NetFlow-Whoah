 *
 * An implementation of the capacity-scaling Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.  As its
 * name suggests, the algorithm works by iteratively calling the Ford-Fulkerson
 * algorithm as a subroutine, constantly updating the capacities, with the aim
 * of computing a maximum s-t flow in the graph.  Amazingly, although the raw
 * Ford-Fulkerson algorithm runs in worst-case exponential time (its runtime
 * depends on the size of the maximum flow in the graph), the capacity-scaling
 * version of the algorithm runs in polynomial time, though the runtime is not
 * strongly polynomial (it depends on the maximum capacity in the graph).
 *
 * The key insight behind the capacity-scaling Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is that
 * we can compute an exact maximum flow by iteratively refining an approximate
 * max-flow until we arrive at the final solution.  In particular, let's
 * assume that all the capacities in the graph can be written out as k-bit
 * binary values.  Begin by constructing the flow network where each capacity
 * is 1 if the most-significant bit of the capacity is 1 and 0 otherwise.  The
 * maximum flow in this graph is m, since in the best possible case each edge
 * in the graph has flow across it.  Now, suppose that we refine this first
 * guess of a max-flow by "uncovering" the next bit of the capacities of each
 * of the edges.  This is equivalent to doubling the flow and capacity across
 * each edge, then possibly increasing the capacities of some edges by one
 * (if the next bit is one).  The doubling step doesn't change the fact that
 * our current flow is a maximum flow; you can see this either by looking at
 * the LP formulation of maximum flow, or by a simple proof by contradiction.
 * This means that if we have a flow of value F from the previous iteration,
 * after the doubling step we now have a flow of value 2F that's still a max-
 * flow.  However, after adding one to some of the edges, our new flow may no
 * longer be a max-flow, but we know that the total amount of flow that could
 * get pushed through this graph is at most 2F + O(m), since each edge (and 
 * its residual edge) might have a new unit of flow pushed across it.  Since
 * we already have a flow of value 2F, this means that if we run the Ford-
 * Fulkerson algorithm in this new graph, it will take at most O(m^2) time to
 * complete.  Repeating this procedure and uncovering progressively more bits
 * until all the bits of the capacities are uncovered will ultimately result
 * in a valid max-flow for the resulting graph.
 *
 * The beauty of this algorithm is that it has a marvelous runtime.  As said
 * above, each iteration of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm takes at most O(m^2)
 * time to complete.  Moreover, the number of iterations is given by the
 * number of bits in the largest-capacity edge in the graph.  This is given by
 * the log of the maximum capacity (which we'll call C), giving us a total
 * runtime of O(m^2 lg C), which is polynomial in the size of the input.  For
 * arbitrary graphs, this is often much faster than the O(mF) guarantee of the
 * raw Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
 *
 * This code relies on the FordFulkerson class also available from the Archive
 * of Interesting Code.  You can find it at
